I wanted to create a macropad that has lot keys, as many as possible. I created a macropad using 12 switches, 1 rp2040, 1 rotary encoder, and 1 Oled 128x32 display.

### Challenges

I used QMK firware. Firmware was the hardest part. I was constantly having errors while compiling. But after few days of trying i barely managed to compile. But i don't even know it will work or not.
